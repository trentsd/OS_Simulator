# CALCULATE runs the process in the simulator in the run state for the 
# number of cycles specified as a parameter

CALCULATE 25

# I/O causes a random number generator to create a parameter that blocks this process
# for a number of cycles

I/O

# YIELD yields from or pauses the running process, halts
# its accumulating cycle time and gives priority to another process (possibly
# through the use of round-robin scheduling). These can act as random
# interrupts in the system

YIELD

# OUT prints a message to the screen

OUT "all your base are belong to us"
